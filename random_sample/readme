# random_sample.py 
# Jonathon Rees and Dilrini De Silva

The random_sample script uses the OpenTree resource to get a newick tree of 
a random sample of N species from taxon T as specified by the user.


The script calls on the OpenTree functions via the "opentree-interfaces" 
opentreelib python library (https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/opentree-interfaces/).

       1. unique_ott_id(name) [tnrs_match_names]: Retrieves the unique OTTid given a higher taxon 
       	  (e.g. Mammalia specified via the -t flag).  
       2. all_species(OTTid) [tree_of_life_subtree]: Retrieves the subtree from given the unique OTTid. 
       	  	2.1. The newick tree is parsed from the returned JSON object. 
	  	2.2. Each node in the newick tree is processed to extract only nodes 
		     that are species using a regex match operation. 
       3. get_random_sample: A random sample of these species is then extracted.
       4. subtree_species [tree_of_life_induced_subtree]: The induced subtree for this random sample 
       	  is then obtained using their OTTids.
       5. The induced subtree is written to file and if '-d' is specified, an image of the tree is
          rendered in either pdf or png format. 


example command line:

python random_sample.py -t Mammalia -m random -n 50 -d -o my_induced_subtree_example -f pdf
