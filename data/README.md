data for sample_taxa
===========

Data subdirectory for the treeforall hackathon project (given the request for a modestly sized tree for a large taxon T, support various useful ways to sample from taxon T)

# Files 

## mammal_genomes.csv 

contents: data on mammalian genomes in NCBI Genomes. The first row is a header line (species,Kingdom,Group,SubGroup,Size (Mb),Chr,Organelles,Plasmids,Assemblies).  It's important for the Arbor workflow that the first column is called "species" 

format: csv.  

provenance: obtained interactively from the NCBI web site.   

## mammal_genomes_tree.nwk and mammal_genomes_tree_no_ids.nwk

contents: tree of mammals with genomes in NCBI.  The "no_ids" tree is reformatted to remove ottIDs and replace spaces with underscores
