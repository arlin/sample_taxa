treeforall hackathon project: Given the request for a modestly sized tree for a large taxon T, support various useful ways to sample from taxon T

## Targets 

1. choose N species randomly from T
2. choose those species from N that have property A, e.g., has NCBI genome
3. choose the top N species from T by relevance metric, e.g., counts in iDigBio

## Data files 

There is a README.md in the data directory
